    description: |
      Date and time after which the provisioner will be automatically
      deleted by the queue.

      type:       object
      title:      Actions
      description: |
        Actions can be defined at any context higher than or at the
        action's level -- so a worker type or provisioner can have
        actions with level=worker. This should avoid unnecessary
        duplication of actions.
      properties:
        label:
          title:        "Label"
          description: |
            Short names for things like logging/error messages.
          type: string
        title:
          title:        "Title"
          description: |
            Appropriate title for any sort of Modal prompt.
        context:
          title:        "Context"
          description: |
            Actions have a "context" that is one of provisioner, worker-type,
            or worker, indicating which it applies to (so this action would
            appear in a menu for a specific worker). Actions can be defined
            at any context higher than or at the action's level -- so a
            worker type or provisioner can have actions with level=worker.
            This should avoid unnecessary duplication of actions.
          type:         string
          enum:         ["provisioner", "worker-type", "worker"]
        url:
          title:        "URL"
          description: |
            When the action is triggered, it will make a POST request to this URL.
            The request will be signed with the user's Taskcluster credentials.

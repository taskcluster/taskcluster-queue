              Actions can be defined at any context higher than or at the
              action's context -- so a worker type or provisioner can have
              actions with context=worker. This should avoid unnecessary
              duplication of actions.

                description: |
                  Actions have a "context" that is one of provisioner, worker-type,
                  or worker, indicating which it applies to (so this action would
                  appear in a menu for a specific worker). Actions can be defined
                  at any context higher than or at the action's context -- so a
                  worker type or provisioner can have actions with context=worker.
                  This should avoid unnecessary duplication of actions.

                  When the action is triggered, it will make a POST request to this URL.

    description: |
      Opaque `continuationToken` to be given as query-string option to get the
      next set of worker-types in the provisioner.
      This property is only present if another request is necessary to fetch all
      results. In practice the next request with a `continuationToken` may not
      return additional results, but it can. Thus, you can only be sure to have
      all the results if you've called `listWorkerTypes` with `continuationToken`
      until you get a result without a `continuationToken`.
